.TH ATMEL_FWL 8
.SH NAME
atmel_fwl \- Load firmware into Atmel at76c50x wireless networking chips.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B atmel_fwl
.I <interface> /path/to/firmware 

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.BR atmel_fwl
loads firmware images for Atmel at76c50x series wireless networking
chips into the Linux driver for same.

Note that this utility is not normally necessary, since the driver will
automatically load the correct firmware image via the hotplug
system. Atmel_fwl is provided for applications where use of the
hotplug system may not be desirable. 

atmel_fwl should be run after the interface has been created (after
card insertion, in the case of PCMCIA cards) but before it is brought
up by running ifconfig.

.SH NOTES
Note that there are two versions of many of the firmware images, the
second one with the suffix "-wpa". These are later releases from Atmel
which support WPA privacy. They are only usable by versions of the
driver greater than 0.9. Be sure not to use the "-wpa" one unless your in-kernel
driver code is version 0.9 or better. Sadly, as of version 0.9, the
in-kernel driver does not actually support the setting of WPA
passphrases.

The firmware images are usually installed in /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware.

The status of the driver, including its firmware loading, is available
in /proc/driver/atmel
